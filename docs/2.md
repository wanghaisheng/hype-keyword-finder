It looks like you've shared a detailed guide on affiliate and display ad keyword research, explaining the process of finding low-competition keywords using Google Keyword Planner and other search modifiers. Here are the key steps and insights from your method:

1. **Keyword Acquisition**: 
   - Use **Google Keyword Planner** to get ideas by entering a niche or seed keyword.
   - Filter out high-competition keywords by using "Keywords To Include" in the tool.

2. **Filtering Keywords**: 
   - Apply **affiliate-based** and **display advertising-based filter words** to refine your keyword list.
   - Aim for keywords that are 3-6 words long with lower search volumes and competition.

3. **Competition Analysis**: 
   - Use **Google search modifiers** like `intitle:`, `inurl:`, `inanchor:` to get insights into competition and determine how competitive a keyword is.
   - Look for results with fewer than 100 entries using the `intitle:""` and `inanchor:""` query for low competition.
   - Use **AHRefs** (via a Firefox plugin) to analyze domain strength, backlinks, and URL ratings.

4. **Checking Top 10 Results**: 
   - Manually check the **top 10 Google results** for your keyword. Key factors to consider:
     - URL rating (UR) over 30 for three or fewer pages.
     - At least 30 referring domains (RD) for three or fewer pages.
     - At least 200 backlinks (BL) for three or fewer pages.
     - Low AHRefs rating for domain authority.
   - Use **Ctrl+F** to see if your target keyword appears in page titles and meta descriptions. If fewer than 3 pages have the keyword in the title and fewer than 5 in the description, it’s a good candidate.

5. **Content Strategy**:
   - If the keyword passes the competition check, proceed with creating **pillar content** with high quality and long word counts.
   - Tools like **Quirk Addon for Firefox** can help with keyword density, although it’s becoming less important as Google updates its algorithms.

Overall, your method emphasizes manual research, filtering, and competitive analysis to select keywords that have a reasonable chance of ranking well with the right content strategy.
